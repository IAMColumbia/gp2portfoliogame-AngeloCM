Description Short: The Dino has to go as far as he can by facing some obstacles. 

Description Long: The game will be passing on a path full of different obstacles, for example: walls, trees, flying birds, holes and more. You, as a Dino, have to dodge all those obstacles and run as far as you can to be able to reach the top of the Score List. However, you just have some possibilities to dodge them, which it's basically by jumping, crouching and spitting fire. Your character also has the possibility to grown, so if he got hit by one of the obstacles, he still survive.
