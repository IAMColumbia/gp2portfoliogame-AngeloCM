Game : Unknown Spirit
Programmer: Angelo Casagrande de Mello

Game Patterns Used: - Strategy Pattern
		    - Observer Pattern

Things Done:
	- Strategy pattern works fine.
	- I have 1 abstract class , which contains other 3 classes implementing some functions.
	- I have an AI working perfectly, but still have some bugs.

Things to be Done:
	- Observer still does not work.
	- Implement a better design for the game.
	- Polish the UI.
